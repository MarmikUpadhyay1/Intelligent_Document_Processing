### **Project Overview: Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**

This project involved designing and implementing an enterprise-wide **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** solution using UiPath for a leading financial services company. The solution aimed to automate the processing of semi-structured and unstructured financial documents, including invoices, contracts, and customer identification records. By leveraging UiPath's robust automation capabilities, the project significantly reduced manual intervention, enhanced data accuracy, and ensured compliance with financial regulations.
